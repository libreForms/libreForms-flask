admin.py: admin console and logic


At it's core, the admin console is a place for admin users to manage the app's behavior. This 
is rooted in a three-step approach for app configuration: `app.config`, `app.config_overrides`,
and `libreforms.env`. The `app.config` file sets the application defaults. The `app.config_overrides`
file, as the name suggests, can be used to override the default configurations. So it takes a higher
precedence than the default `app.configs` file. Finally, the system searchs for a `libreforms.env` 
file, which takes precedence over the other two files. This admin script will work primarily with 
that libreforms.env file and, when you're running gunicorn, will automatically reload the WSGI
server when it detects changes to that file. We are still working through how to get the 
werkzeug WSGI server to reload when it detects changes to that file, too. For further discussion, 
see https://github.com/libreForms/libreForms-flask/issues/255.

Generally, the admin console will try to provide the following features, though some of the
features themselves are `far horizon` features that are not currently planned in the libreForms-flask
backlog, see https://github.com/libreForms/libreForms-flask/issues/39.

    Database externalization
    Add LDAP / OAuth Authentication
    SMTP Configuration
    File System Configuration (set max file upload size)
    User and Group/Role Configuration
    Log Access
    REST API privileges (read-only or full CRUD)
    External forms (allowed or not)
    Data backup, rotation, management, retention, restore-from-backup
    Look and Feel (display overrides)
    Signing Key rotation
